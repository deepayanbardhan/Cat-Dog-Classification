## Cat-Dog-Classification

This code is for the Kaggle contest given in the link below:

The basic task is to categorize cats and dogs into 2 different classes. I have used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to perform the task and also compared the results with a feed forward ANN (Artificial Neural Network). Although the test is performed on a very small data-set because of inconvenience the results are however comparable and gives us a fair idea of how the models are supposed to work.
